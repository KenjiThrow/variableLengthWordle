# About The Project 
A really quick game I made for APCSP Final Project. 
Variable-length wordle game, with a randomized length of 4-7 words when you start.

# How It's Made
Tech used: Java, Processing

# Lessons Learned
Always always do some note-writing for a general idea/direction of the game.  
Map out all the variables you might need, sometimes taking steps back to see if some can be resued for efficiency and readability. 

# Getting Started
If someone ever stumbles upon this abomination of a project, download Processing first and make sure it is running Java (should be so by default).  
cmd-c + cmd-v my code or download and open in Processing from the runInProcessing.java file into the game, hit 'run' or the big play button at the top.
